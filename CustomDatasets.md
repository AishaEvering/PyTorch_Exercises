## ðŸ“™ [Jupyter Notebook](https://github.com/AishaEvering/PyTorch_Exercises/blob/main/04_pytorch_custom_datasets_exercises.ipynb)

* **ðŸ”‘ Key Takeaways**
   * Use PyTorch torchvision transform to resize and alter images for more variability in the test data.
   * Created custom dataset class, which was pretty straight forward.
   * Experimented multiple models with various custom datasets and epochs
* **ðŸ˜¤ Where I Got Stuck**

  * Not getting great results from the models this time.  That was not really the point to the exercise to I didn't spend a lot of time adding transformations or tuning hyperparameters.  But I'll probably return to this is get higher accuracy values.
 
* **ðŸ¤“ TIL (I have my hand in several aspects of Machine Learning so sometimes I will come across something I thought was cool and need a place to remember it.  This is that place.)**

  * here weren't a lot of 'AHA!' moments, but I was introduced to how to augment images using TensorFlow-like techniques in PyTorch in this chapter. I experimented with many of the torchvision.transforms and still didn't cover them all. This is a great way to increase your data variability.
