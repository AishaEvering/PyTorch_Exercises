# Deploying Models!
<sup>[Go to Read Me](https://github.com/AishaEvering/PyTorch_Exercises/blob/main/README.md)</sup>

Deploying models!!! Finally I made it to deploying uploading models and having live demos.

* **ðŸ”‘ Key Takeaways**
   * I've been practicing various ways to deploy a model from cloud services to edge devices. This was of deploying to an edge device and the most straight forward way I've encountered.
   * This is more for demo purposes and less for production use because I didn't add any real error handling. For instance, if you upload a image that's not expected the mode will still attempt to predict it.  In the future I think I will look for low prediction totals and return "Unknown" if the sum of the predictions are below a certain threshold.
   * Since model or feature extractor is for an edge device the size of the model really mattered.
   * Adding data augmentation was sooooo needed for the overfitting on the Food101 and Oxford III Pet datasets.
   * Gradio and Hugging Faces are fast and convenient!!!!
* **ðŸ˜¤ Where I Got Stuck**
  * The training time on the full Food101 dataset was ~18 minutes.  Also downloading the model took forever.  Google Colab kept having to reconnect.
 
* **ðŸ¤“ TIL (I have my hand in several aspects of Machine Learning so sometimes I will come across something I thought was cool and need a place to remember it.  This is that place.)**

  * Label smoothing is a technique used in training neural networks to improve model performance and generalization. It addresses the issue of overconfidence in model predictions by softening the target labels.
