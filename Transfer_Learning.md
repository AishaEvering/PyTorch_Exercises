* **ðŸ”‘ Key Takeaways**
   * I'm not new to transfer learning but doing it with PyTorch seems to be much more straight forward.
   * When choosing a a base model consider the...
      * Speed - How fast does it run?
      * Size - How big is the model?
      * Performance - How well does it handle your chosen problem.
         * Where does the model live?  On a server with a lot of compute or on a mobel app?
    * After that it's all about transforming the data correctrly.
    * Then updating your classifier layer (in my case) to have the correct number of output features.
    * Easy Peasy

* **ðŸ˜¤ Where I Got Stuck**

  * There are multiple ways of training a model.  When I tried the way of using weights.transform to train my data things did not go well. (Update
) I figured it out.  It's the best way to go just in case the recipe for transforming the data for the base model changes.
 
* **ðŸ¤“ TIL (I have my hand in several aspects of Machine Learning so sometimes I will come across something I thought was cool and need a place to remember it.  This is that place.)**

  * I've come to the conclusion that most models are using transfering learning from bigger models these days.  Why start from scratch?  No reason.
